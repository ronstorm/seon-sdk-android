# SeonSDK (Android)

### Capture, Store, and View Photos with Ease ðŸ“¸

**SeonSDK** is a lightweight, easy-to-integrate library for Android that provides seamless functionalities to capture photos, store them securely, and view them in a beautifully designed gallery. With built-in biometric authentication, you can ensure that only authorized users can access stored photos.

## Objective

The objective of **SeonSDK** is to provide a simplified and unified interface for photo management within Android applications, allowing developers to quickly integrate camera functionalities, secure photo storage, and access with user authentication using the device's built-in biometric capabilities.

## How to Integrate in Your Application

To integrate **SeonSDK** into your Android application, follow these simple steps:

1. **Add AAR Files to Your Project**: 
   - Download the [SeonSDK Libraries](https://github.com/ronstorm/seonsdk-libraries/tree/master/Android) and place them in your projectâ€™s `libs` folder.

2. **Update `AndroidManifest.xml` for Camera and Media Permissions**:
   - Add the following lines to request permissions for camera and media access:
     ```xml
     <uses-feature
         android:name="android.hardware.camera"
         android:required="false" />

     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES" />
     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_MEDIA_VIDEO" />
     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_MEDIA_AUDIO" />
     ```

3. **Add Dependencies to `build.gradle.kts` (App Module)**:
   - Add the following dependencies to your appâ€™s `build.gradle.kts` file to include required libraries:
     ```kotlin
     implementation("androidx.biometric:biometric:1.1.0")
     implementation("androidx.camera:camera-core:1.3.4")
     implementation("androidx.camera:camera-camera2:1.3.4")
     implementation("androidx.camera:camera-lifecycle:1.3.4")
     implementation("androidx.camera:camera-view:1.3.4")
     implementation("androidx.camera:camera-extensions:1.3.4")
     implementation("androidx.exifinterface:exifinterface:1.3.7")
     ```

4. **Initialize the SDK in Your Application Class**:
   - Initialize the SeonSDK inside your application class by adding the following code:
     ```kotlin
     class TestApplication : Application() {

         override fun onCreate() {
             super.onCreate()
             // Initialize PhotoSDK with the application context
             PhotoSDK.initialize(this)
         }
     }
     ```

## Usage

Below is a quick guide on how to use **SeonSDK** in your application:

```kotlin
// Import the SDK
import com.example.seonsdk.main.PhotoSDK

// Use the takePhoto() method to capture photos
val cameraFragment = PhotoSDK.takePhoto(
    onError = { errorMessage ->
        // Handle error (e.g., show a toast)
        println("Error capturing photo: $errorMessage")
    },
    onSuccess = { photoFile ->
        // Handle the captured photo (e.g., display or save the file)
        println("Photo captured: ${photoFile.path}")
    }
)

// Use the accessPhotos() method to access photos securely
PhotoSDK.accessPhotos(
    activity = this, // Pass the current activity
    onAuthenticated = { galleryFragment ->
        // Display the gallery fragment
        println("Gallery accessed successfully.")
    },
    onError = { errorMessage ->
        // Handle authentication or access error (e.g., show a toast)
        println("Error accessing gallery: $errorMessage")
    }
)
```
